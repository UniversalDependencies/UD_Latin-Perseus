# Summary

This Universal Dependencies Latin Treebank consists of an automatic
conversion of a selection of passages from the Ancient Greek and Latin
Dependency Treebank 2.1

# Introduction

The current UD treebank derives from texts taken from
the Ancient Greek and Latin Dependency Treebank 2.1 available at

* https://github.com/PerseusDL/treebank_data/tree/master/v2.1/Latin

The original data have been semi-automatically annotated. More precisely,
morphological annotation and lemmatization have been performed with the help of
the Morpheus morphological analyzer, while syntactic annotation has been done
manually. The following guidelines have been followed:
